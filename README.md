# Welcome to HackArmour

### Who are we?
We are a community of hackers, devs and creative people who aim to create a community platform where everyone can learn tech stuff and mingle with the community accessibly.

Currently we are focusing on community building, and our future goal includes to make a infosec search engine to search relevant stuff about cybersecurity and hacking.
